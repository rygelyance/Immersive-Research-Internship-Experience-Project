## Research Question

Which demographic groups are impacted by light rail openings in the United States?

## Research Context

We're focused on the "Twin Cities", Minneapolis and St. Paul, Minnesota and the impact of the opening of the METRO Blue and METRO Green lines.

Timeline: 2000-2008

Hypothesis: Light rail openings decrease the pollution around stations

-   Reasoning: While light rail openings gather commuters, only two of the stations have parking, so on average, the net PM2.5 pollution should in theory be lower. In addition, many of these commuters are electing to use the light rail instead of their own transportation, further contributing to a reduction in PM2.5

-   Confounding Factors:

    -   Power Plants

    -   Recycling Centers

    -   Refineries

    -   Factories

    -   Heating Plants

    -   Paper Mills

    -   Meteorological Factors

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library("knitr")
figure1 <- read.csv("Sources of Pollution - Twin Cities - Sheet1 (2).csv")
kable(figure1)
```

## Green & Blue Line Stations

Below is a list of all 37 stations for the METRO Green and Blue Lines.

```{r}
figure2 <- read.csv("Twin Cities Stations - Sheet1.csv")
kable(figure2)
```

## Station Information

This code reads the data from csv files we created that contains the names of each station . The METRO Blue and Green lines in total have 37 stations. This file has the name of each station, their addresses, opening dates, and whether or not they have parking.

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library("tidyverse")
library("ggmap") 

station_data <- read.csv("Twin Cities Stations - Sheet1.csv") %>%
  mutate(Station2=paste(Stations, "Station Metro Transit, Minnesota"))
```

This next segments use a Google API key in order to get the locations of each station of the light rail in latitude/longitude coordinates, then fixes a few select points where the Google API failed to get a precise location.

```{r}
#| eval: false
register_google(key = "GoogleAPIKey", write = TRUE)

addr.geo <- mutate_geocode(station_data, location = Station2, output = "latlona")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
geo <- addr.geo %>%
  mutate(lat2 = ifelse(address=="bloomington, mn, usa", 44.85639, lat)) %>%
  mutate(lon2 = ifelse(address=="bloomington, mn, usa", -93.22628, lon)) %>%
  mutate(lat2 = ifelse(address=="minnesota, usa", 44.95648, lat2)) %>%
  mutate(lon2 = ifelse(address=="minnesota, usa", -93.17874, lon2)) %>%
  mutate(lat2 = ifelse(Station2=="Western Avenue station Metro Transit, Minnesota", 44.95586, lat2)) %>%
  mutate(lon2 = ifelse(Station2=="Western Avenue station Metro Transit, Minnesota", -93.11708, lon2))

```

## Plotting the Stations

This next code segment plots each of the station locations (in latitude/longitude) we extracted in the previous stage

```{r}
#| warning: false
#| message: false
library("terra")
geo <- read.csv("stations_with_locations.csv")

sample_coords <- cbind(geo$lon2, geo$lat2)
lr_stations <- vect(sample_coords)
geom(lr_stations)
crdref <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
pts <- vect(sample_coords, crs=crdref)
plot(pts)

```

## Plotting the Stations (Part 2)

This code chunk displays the station locations on top of a real map with a 500m buffer circle around each station location. These buffers and their sizes are to help to later extract the average PM2.5 and control data for each of the stations individually while limiting the influence of potential other sources of PM2.5 as well as overlap with other stations.

```{r}
library("terra")
library("maptiles")
geo <- read.csv("stations_with_locations.csv")

pts_buffer <- buffer(pts, width = 500) # Width is measured in meters
plot(pts_buffer)

#writeVector(pts_buffer, "Station_Buffers.shp")

tc_lr <- vect("lr_1km_buff/lr_1km_buff.shp")
tc_lr_line <- aggregate(tc_lr, dissolve = TRUE)
lr_project <- project(tc_lr_line, "+proj=longlat + ellps = WGS84 +datum = WGS84 + nodefs")

lrc <- centroids(lr_project, inside = FALSE)

pts_buffer1 <- buffer(lrc, width = 10000)
extent <- buffer(pts, width = 600)

bg <- get_tiles(ext(extent))
plot(bg)
points(pts)
lines(pts_buffer1, col = "blue")
lines(pts_buffer, col = "red")
```

## Find Sources of Pollution near Light Rail Routes and its Addresses

This file has the name of each factory, their addresses, opening dates, and whether or not they have parking.

```{r}
library("tidyverse")
library("ggmap") 

factory_data <- read.csv("Sources of Pollution - Twin Cities - Sheet1 (2).csv") %>%
  mutate(Factory2=paste(Factories, "Factory, Minnesota"))
```

This next segments use a Google API key in order to get the locations of each station of the light rail in latitude/longitude coordinates, then fixes a few select points where the Google API failed to get a precise location.

```{r}
#| eval: false
register_google(key = "GoogleAPIKey", write = TRUE)

addr.geo <- mutate_geocode(factory_data, location = Factory2, output = "latlona")
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
geo2 <- addr.geo %>%
  mutate(lat2 = ifelse(Factories=="Flint Hills Resources Line Bend Refinery, Rosemount, MN", 44.76432, lat)) %>%
  mutate(lon2 = ifelse(Factories=="Flint Hills Resources Line Bend Refinery, Rosemount, MN", -93.03947, lon)) %>%
  mutate(lat2 = ifelse(Factories=="Koch Industries (Flint Hills Resources), Rosemount, MN", 44.76424, lat2)) %>%
  mutate(lon2 = ifelse(Factories=="Koch Industries (Flint Hills Resources), Rosemount, MN", -93.03943, lon2))

write.csv(geo2, "pollution_locations.csv")
```

## Plotting the Factory Sources of Pollution

```{r}
library("terra")
geo <- read.csv("stations_with_locations.csv")
geo2 <- read.csv("pollution_locations.csv")

sample_coords <- cbind(geo$lon2, geo$lat2)
lr_stations <- vect(sample_coords)
geom(lr_stations)
crdref <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
pts <- vect(sample_coords, crs=crdref)

pol_coords <- cbind(geo2$lon2, geo2$lat2)
crdref <- "+proj=longlat +datum=WGS84"
pol_pts <- vect(pol_coords, crs=crdref)

library("maptiles")

plot(pts)
pts_buffer <- buffer(pts, width = 500) # Width is measured in meters
plot(pts_buffer)

lrc <- centroids(lr_project, inside = FALSE)

pts_buffer1 <- buffer(lrc, width = 10000)
extent <- buffer(pts, width = 600)

bg <- get_tiles(ext(extent))
plot(bg)
points(pts)
points(pol_pts, col = "purple", cex = 1.5)
lines(pts_buffer1, col = "blue")
lines(pts_buffer, col = "red")
```

## Plotting Meteorology Data

```{r}
#| eval: false

library("terra")
library("tidyverse")

#makes of list of files in that folder
files<-dir("G:/Shared drives/2024 FIRE Light Rail/DATA/GLDAS/")

for(i in 1:3288){
  r<-rast(paste0("G:/Shared drives/2024 FIRE Light Rail/DATA/GLDAS/", files[i]))

  names(r)
  #variables in page 19 of manual
  #https://hydro1.gesdisc.eosdis.nasa.gov/data/GLDAS/GLDAS_CLSM025_D.2.0/doc       /README_GLDAS2.pdf
  #Snowf_tavg<-r[[6]]
  #plot(Snowf_tavg)

  station_buffers<-vect("Station_Buffers.shp")

  #crops raster to contain only buffers around stations
  int<-crop(r, station_buffers,
            snap="in",
            mask=TRUE)
  plot(int)

  #convert cropped raster into dataframe and find average value
  metdf<-terra::extract(int, sta, fun="mean", na.rm=TRUE)  %>% 
    summarise(across(where(is.numeric), ~ mean(.x, na.rm = TRUE))) %>%
    select(-ID)

  metdf$date<-files[i]
  
  write.csv(metdf, paste0("TC_Meteorology_Data/", files[i],".csv"), row.names = F)

}
```

## Plotting PM2.5 of the different stations over time

This code plots the PM2.5 on each date for each station in order to determine which stations should be excluded from the data for being outliers.

```{r}
#| warning: false
library(ggplot2)

all_data = read.csv("Mega_Dataframe.csv")
truncated_data = head(all_data, 5000)

ggplot(data = all_data, aes(x = station_num, y = pm25)) +
  geom_boxplot(outlier.shape = NA, aes(group = station_num, color = factor(station_num))) +
  ylim(0, 25)
```
